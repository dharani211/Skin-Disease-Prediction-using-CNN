The increased pollution levels are leading to increasing in the number of people
are suffering from skin diseases. More than 125 million people
suffering from Psoriasis also skin cancer rate is rapidly increasing
over the last few decades especially Melanoma is the most diversifying
skin cancer. If skin diseases are not treated at an earlier stage, then it
may lead to complications in the body including the spreading of the
infection from one individual to the other. The skin diseases can
be prevented by investigating the infected region at an early
stage. The characteristic of the skin images is diversified so
that it is challenging job to devise an efficient and robust
algorithm for automatic detection of the skin disease and its
severity. To overcome the above problem we are building a
model which is used for the prevention and early detection of
Acne, Melanoma, psoriasis, Rosacea, vitiligo. An application is
built where a person can upload an image from UI, the image will
be sent to the trained model. The model analyses the image and
detects the skin disease that person had. Our system will use a
Convolution neural network to train the images of skin diseases.
